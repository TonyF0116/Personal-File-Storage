# Personal-File-Storage

A personal file storage system, in which you can store and view pictures and other files. You can also create and edit simple excel and pdf files. 

The website implements SSO (Single Sign On) using JWT. Token was stored in Authorization header. Some modification was made to simulate the SSO process on different websites (now happening on account page, index page, and edit page).
